**Environment Context (Email Rewording)**

*   **Communication Goal:** [What is the purpose of the email? e.g.,  Apologize for a delay, request information, follow up after a meeting, etc.]
*   **Target Audience:** [Who are you writing to? e.g.,  Customers, colleagues, your boss, a potential client, etc.]
*   **Desired Tone:** [What feeling do you want the email to convey? e.g.,  Friendly, professional but approachable, empathetic, direct, enthusiastic, etc.  *Crucially, what tone are you trying to AVOID that sounds like an LLM? e.g.,  Generic, overly formal, robotic, bland, too concise, etc.*]

**Now, let's go through the adapted Query Creation Workflow for Email Rewording:**

**Cycle Overview**

**1. Start Phase (Understanding the Original Email and Goal)**

*   **Please provide the original email text that you want to reword.** Paste it here:
    ```
    [Insert original email text here]
    ```
*   **Clarifying Questions (to understand what needs rewording):**
    *   **What specifically about the current email makes it sound like it was written by an LLM?** (e.g., word choices, sentence structure, tone, lack of personal touch, etc.)
    *   **What aspects of the email are you happy with and want to keep?** (e.g., the core message, certain factual details, etc.)
    *   **What is the *key message* you want to ensure comes across in the reworded email?**
    *   **Are there any specific phrases or sentences you *definitely* want to change?**

**2. Refining Phase**

*   **Based on your answers above and the original email, let's identify the "LLM-like" elements.**  We can think of these as "columns" we want to modify in our "email table."  Examples might be:
    *   **Overly formal language:**  "Utilize" instead of "use," "peruse" instead of "read."
    *   **Generic phrasing:**  "I hope this email finds you well,"  "As per our previous conversation."
    *   **Lack of personality:**  No contractions, no personal anecdotes, too direct and transactional.
    *   **Repetitive sentence structure:**  Starting too many sentences the same way.
    *   **Too concise/abrupt:**  Lacking politeness or softening language.

*   **Let's also identify the "desired human-like elements" we want to inject.**  These are the "new columns" we want to create:
    *   **More conversational language:** Using contractions, simpler vocabulary, more natural flow.
    *   **Personal touches:**  Referencing something specific to the recipient or the context (if appropriate).
    *   **Warmer tone:**  Using more empathetic or friendly language.
    *   **Varied sentence structure:**  Mixing up sentence length and beginnings.
    *   **Slightly less direct (if appropriate for the tone):**  Using softening phrases, building rapport.

**3. Creating the Reworded Email**

*   **Upon receiving the prompt "REWORD" from you:**
    *   I will rewrite the email based on all the information we've gathered in the Start and Refining phases.
    *   I will focus on removing the identified "LLM-like" elements and incorporating the "human-like" elements.
    *   I will aim to maintain the core message and purpose of the original email while making it sound more natural and authentic.

**Useful Information**

*   **Common "LLM-isms" to avoid:**  Overuse of words like "leverage," "synergy," "optimize," "proactive," "streamline,"  very formal greetings and closings,  generic pleasantries.
*   **Strategies for Humanizing Email:**
    *   **Use contractions:** "I'm," "you're," "we'll," "can't."
    *   **Use simpler vocabulary:**  Choose everyday words over jargon or overly complex terms.
    *   **Incorporate personal touches (if appropriate):**  A brief friendly opening or closing, a reference to something you know about the recipient or the situation.
    *   **Read it aloud:**  Does it sound like something a person would naturally say?
    *   **Imagine you're talking to the recipient in person:**  How would you phrase it conversationally?
