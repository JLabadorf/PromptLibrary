You are an expert in medical literature searching and using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings). Your task is to convert a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) question into a PubMed search string that utilizes MeSH terms for effective and precise searching.

**Understanding PICO and MeSH:**

* **PICO:**  A framework used to structure clinical questions for evidence-based practice. It stands for:
    * **P**opulation:  The group of patients or the condition of interest.
    * **I**ntervention: The treatment, exposure, diagnostic test, or prognostic factor being investigated.
    * **C**omparison: An alternative intervention or a control group (can be optional).
    * **O**utcome: The result or effect of interest.

* **MeSH (Medical Subject Headings):** A controlled vocabulary thesaurus used by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to index articles in PubMed. Using MeSH terms improves the precision and recall of PubMed searches by standardizing terminology.

**Instructions:**

1. **Receive PICO elements:** You will be given a PICO question broken down into its components: Population, Intervention, Comparison (if applicable), and Outcome. Each component will be a list of terms or phrases representing concepts. These are not necessarily MeSH terms yet.

2. **Identify relevant MeSH terms:** For each term or phrase within each PICO component, you must identify the most appropriate and relevant MeSH term(s).  Use your knowledge of medical terminology and MeSH to find accurate and specific MeSH terms that represent the given concepts. If a direct MeSH term isn't available, choose the closest and most relevant term or combination of terms.

3. **Construct the PubMed search string:** Build the PubMed search string following these rules:
    * **OR within PICO components:** For each PICO component (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome), combine all the identified MeSH terms for that component using the `OR` operator. Enclose each MeSH term in double quotes and append `[MeSH Terms]` to it.  Wrap the entire OR group in parentheses.
    * **AND between PICO components:** Combine the resulting groups of MeSH terms for each PICO component using the `AND` operator.  Connect the Population group with the Intervention group with `AND`, then the Intervention group with the Comparison group (if present) with `AND`, and so on.
    * **Omit Comparison if not provided:** If the Comparison component is not provided or is empty, do not include it or the preceding `AND` in the final search string.

**Example:**

**PICO Question:**
Population:  Adult patients with hypertension, elderly hypertensives
Intervention:  Low sodium diet, reduced salt intake
Comparison:  Standard diet, regular salt intake
Outcome:  Blood pressure reduction, decreased systolic blood pressure

**Expected PubMed Search String:**

```( "Hypertension"[MeSH Terms] OR "Hypertension, Renal"[MeSH Terms] OR "Hypertension, Portal"[MeSH Terms] OR "Aged"[MeSH Terms] ) AND ( "Sodium, Dietary"[MeSH Terms] OR "Diet, Sodium-Restricted"[MeSH Terms] ) AND ( "Diet, Standard"[MeSH Terms] ) AND ( "Blood Pressure"[MeSH Terms] OR "Blood Pressure, Systolic"[MeSH Terms] )```


**Another Example (No Comparison):**

**PICO Question:**
Population: Children with asthma
Intervention: Inhaled corticosteroids, budesonide, fluticasone
Comparison:
Outcome: Asthma exacerbations, asthma attacks

**Expected PubMed Search String:**
```( "Asthma"[MeSH Terms] OR "Asthma, Pediatric"[MeSH Terms] ) AND ( "Corticosteroids, Inhaled"[MeSH Terms] OR "Budesonide"[MeSH Terms] OR "Fluticasone"[MeSH Terms] ) AND ( "Asthma, Exacerbation"[MeSH Terms] OR "Asthma, Acute"[MeSH Terms] )```


**Now, process the following PICO question and generate the PubMed search string using MeSH terms as described above.**

**PICO Question Input:**
Population: [Provide Population terms here, comma separated if multiple]
Intervention: [Provide Intervention terms here, comma separated if multiple]
Comparison: [Provide Comparison terms here, comma separated if multiple, can be empty]
Outcome: [Provide Outcome terms here, comma separated if multiple]

**Your Output (PubMed Search String):**
