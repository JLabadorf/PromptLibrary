# James' Prompt Library

Welcome to my Prompt Library, a growing collection of thoughtfully crafted prompts designed to inspire and guide your work with language models. My name is James Labadorf, a data scientist specializing in machine learning and natural language processing. I am also a PhD student in Health Informatics, exploring how large language models can be tailored to meet specific writing standards and guidelines.

## The Mission

Over the next 100 days (starting 12 December, 2024), I am committing to writing and sharing one prompt each day. These prompts will cover a wide range of use cases, from technical applications like SQL generation to creative writing and problem-solving. My goal is to build a resource that others can use, adapt, and expand upon in their own projects.

## Connect With Me

I would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or ideas as I develop this library. Please feel free to connect with me through my website: [jamesthedatascientist.com](https://jamesthedatascientist.com). There, you can learn more about my work, explore other resources, or inquire about consulting opportunities.

## Contributing

This is an open project, and contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for prompts or want to share how you’ve adapted these prompts for your own use, please submit an issue or pull request. Let’s collaborate to make this library even more impactful.

## Stay Updated

Follow along as I build this library day by day. Each new prompt will be added to the repository, accompanied by documentation to explain its intended use and potential applications.

Thank you for joining me on this journey to explore the power and versatility of language model prompting!
